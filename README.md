# Fibonacci heap
This project implements a Fibonacci Heap. The operations performed by the code include:
• Inserting the values: first ‘3‘, then ‘7‘, followed by ‘17‘ and finally ‘24‘
• Removing the minimum node from the root list and restructuring the heap
• Retrieving the current minimum value in the heap without removing it
